#' LXSmRNA Matrix
#'
#' A matrix containing expression levels (or relevant measures) of 14,184 features across 232 samples.
#' These samples are classified into two groups: 'Saline' and 'Ethanol'. This dataset aims to capture
#' the potential differential expression or behavior of these features under the two conditions.

#' @details
#' The `LXSmRNA` matrix represents a comprehensive dataset capturing the responses or behavior
#' of various molecular features (potentially genes or other RNA molecules) under two different conditions: Saline and Ethanol.
#' Each row in the matrix corresponds to a distinct feature, and each column represents a unique sample.
#' The values within the matrix could represent expression levels, counts, or other relevant measures.
#'
#' The dataset plays a pivotal role in understanding the comparative behavior of these features
#' between the two groups and could potentially be used for differential expression analysis, clustering,
#' or other relevant bioinformatics or statistical analyses.
